GPU Utilization and Testing Scripts
For 16GB of GPU memory, you have several good options for language models. Let me break them down based on approximate memory requirements during inference:
Models that should fit comfortably (8-12GB):

BART Large (1.6GB base, ~4GB during inference)
T5-Large (2.7GB base, ~6GB during inference)
RoBERTa Large (1.3GB base, ~4GB during inference)
GPT-2 Large (1.5GB base, ~5GB during inference)
DeBERTa-V3-Large (1.5GB base, ~5GB during inference)

Models that will work but with less headroom (12-15GB):

T5-3B (using 8-bit quantization)
FLAN-T5-XL (with appropriate quantization)
OPT-6.7B (with 8-bit quantization)
BLOOMZ-7B1 (with 8-bit quantization)
Llama-2-7B (with 8-bit quantization)

Some optimization techniques to fit larger models:

Use 8-bit quantization (reduces memory by ~50%)
Use 4-bit quantization (reduces memory by ~75%)
Enable gradient checkpointing
Use attention mechanisms like Flash Attention
Process smaller batch sizes

Here's a quick code example showing how to load a model with quantization:
python

from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model_id = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b"  # or any other model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    device_map="auto",
    load_in_8bit=True,  # Enable 8-bit quantization
    torch_dtype=torch.float16  # Use half precision
)

Llama 2 7B without any quantization requires approximately 28GB of GPU memory during inference. Here's the rough breakdown:

Model Parameters: ~13.5GB

7 billion parameters * 16 bits (float16) / 8 bits per byte
Even in float16 precision, each parameter needs 2 bytes


Additional Memory Requirements:

Attention mechanism overhead: ~8GB
Activations and intermediate computations: ~4GB
KV cache for inference: ~2GB
CUDA kernels and other runtime overhead: ~0.5GB



Total: ~28GB for comfortable inference
This is why Llama 2 7B is typically run with quantization on consumer GPUs:

8-bit quantization brings it down to ~14GB
4-bit quantization brings it down to ~7GB
Mixed 4-bit/8-bit quantization (like QLoRA) brings it to ~8-10GB

For your 16GB GPU, you would definitely need to use quantization to run Llama 2 7B. 

Let me break down some of the smallest but effective LLMs for generative tasks like summarization:

BART-base (~140MB model size, ~500MB in memory)


Good for summarization and text generation
Much smaller than BART-large (1.6GB)
Can run on CPU or low-end GPUs


DistilBART (~280MB model size, ~800MB in memory)


Distilled version of BART
Specifically good for summarization
Maintains good quality while being much smaller


T5-small (~242MB model size, ~800MB in memory)


Very versatile for multiple tasks
Good balance of size and performance
Works well for summarization


GPT-2-small (~124MB model size, ~500MB in memory)


Smallest GPT-2 variant
Good for general text generation
Can be fine-tuned for specific tasks
